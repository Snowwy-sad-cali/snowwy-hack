Uninstall and reinstall the chrome extension. There has been an update.
# ❄️ 1.2 Snowwy Hack

Become Cold, Become A Snowwy...

### Chromium Extension
Remove all exisiting scripts.

1. Navigate to chrome://extensions
2. Enable developer mode (probably a checkbox in the top right)
3. Download: <form>
<input type="button" value="Here" onclick="window.location.href='https://github.com/Snowwy-sad-cali/snowwy-hack/raw/master/loader/Snowwy%20hack%20loader.zip'" />
</form>
4. Unzip and drag the folder into the extensions page

If you can figure out reliable ways to identify the presence of the extension running then I am interested to know how.
