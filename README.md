Uninstall and reinstall the chrome extension. There has been an update.

Become Cold, Become A Snowwy...

### Chromium Extension
Remove all exisiting scripts.

1. Navigate to chrome://extensions
2. Enable developer mode (probably a checkbox in the top right)
3. Download everything by clicking clone or download then click download as zip
4. Drag the downloaded zip into the extensions page

If you can figure out reliable ways to identify the presence of the extension running then I am interested to know how.
